## ACCESSIBILITY:
I used accessibility code to increase this page's web accessibility. I mostly used aria-role landmarks and tabindex code to increase focus and access. There is a strong movement in the web development world to build and code web content that is accessible to everybody. Lawsuits and accessility standards are happenning regularly. Some statistics report there are over 1 billion people worldwide who have difficulties using web content because of different disabilities.
